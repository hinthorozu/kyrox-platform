## Unreleased

### Central Activities screen + hard delete (ADR-033)

- Org-wide `GET /api/v1/activities` with server-side search, customer, type, status, date-range filters
- Single hard delete `DELETE /api/v1/activities/{id}` → `204` (physical row removal)
- Bulk hard delete `POST /api/v1/activities/bulk-delete` with partial-result reporting
- Frontend `/activities` central list: UniversalDataTable, dual pagination, row selection, detail modal, confirm dialogs
- Worklist `last_activity_id` remains `ON DELETE SET NULL` (no silent cascade of unrelated rows)
- Decision: [decisions/DECISIONS.md](decisions/DECISIONS.md) ADR-033

### Width-responsive table standard (ADR-032 update)

- Default list engine: `UniversalDataTable` → `WidthResponsiveDataTable` (container width, column order = priority, child rows)
- Dual top+bottom pagination default via `ServerDataTableFrame` / `ServerDataTablePagination`
- Column squeezing / letter-break wrapping forbidden; `priority: "technical"` stays detail-only
- `ResponsiveDataTable` deprecated as thin adapter; all UniversalDataTable screens inherit the standard
- Docs: [frontend/RESPONSIVE_UI_STANDARD.md](frontend/RESPONSIVE_UI_STANDARD.md)

### Global Responsive UI Design System (ADR-032)

- Shared responsive standard for all Fair CRM screens (390 / 768 / 1024 / 1440)
- Form/filter 3/2/1, `FilterPanel`, `TruncatedText`, `TechnicalDetails`, modal bottom-sheet
- List tables: width-responsive engine (see above)
- [frontend/RESPONSIVE_UI_STANDARD.md](frontend/RESPONSIVE_UI_STANDARD.md)

### Import Job Permanent Delete

- `DELETE /api/v1/data-integration/imports/{batch_id}` — hard delete batch, rows, jobs, stored Excel bytes
- Active analyze/apply job or `analyzing`/`applying` status blocks delete (409)
- Import list **Sil** button with confirmation dialog + success toast

### Import Job Resume Flow + Decision Bulk Actions

- Upload sonrası Import İşleri listesine yönlendirme
- **Devam Et** — status-aware setup/decision resume (`/imports/continue/:id`)
- Bulk preview: `POST .../bulk-actions/preview` (veri değiştirmez)
- Bulk apply job: `POST .../bulk-actions/apply` (202, background)
- Batch apply/bulk lock (409); idempotent bulk (skip rows with decision)
- [../../archive/fair-crm/reports/IMPORT_RESUME_BULK_COMPLETION.md](../../archive/fair-crm/reports/IMPORT_RESUME_BULK_COMPLETION.md)

### Company Name Matching Stabilization

- Turkish-aware normalization + legal suffix / abbreviation handling
- Token-based scoring with confidence bands (70 / 85 / 95)
- Match explanations stored on import rows (`_match_explanation`)
- [../../archive/fair-crm/reports/COMPANY_NAME_MATCHING_COMPLETION.md](../../archive/fair-crm/reports/COMPANY_NAME_MATCHING_COMPLETION.md)

### Universal Excel Import — Column Mapping Grid + Analysis Queue

- Excel preview + per-column mapping grid (dropdown per column)
- Wizard setup: upload → sheet → header → mapping grid → Import Jobs list
- Batch lifecycle statuses (`mapping_completed`, `analysis_queued`, `analyzing`, `decision_required`, …)

- `docker-compose.yml` — `restart: unless-stopped` on PostgreSQL
- `scripts/dev/dev-lib.ps1` — shared Docker/runtime helpers
- `scripts/dev/dev-start.ps1` — idempotent auto-start (Docker + backend + frontend)
- `scripts/dev/dev-stop.ps1` — stop runtime processes; optional `-StopInfra`
- `scripts/dev/reset-dev.ps1` — refactored to use `dev-lib.ps1` (force reset unchanged)

### Shipped (implementation)

- Customer hard-delete cascade safety (ADR-020) — migrations `0012` / `0013`; archive preserved, DR hard delete cascades
- **Backup format options (Sprint 09.2.4 / ADR-021)** — Admin create modal: `.dump` (DR), `.sql` (plain export), Universal Data Package `.zip` (MVP)
- Migration `0014_backup_format_options` — `backup_format`, `manifest_json` on `system_backups`
- `UniversalDataPackageService` — vendor-independent JSON + manifest ZIP export (not restore)
- Restore remains `.dump`-only; SQL and data package are export/migration formats
- **Universal Server-Side DataTable Sorting Rule (ADR-019)** — mandatory sortable data columns except Actions
- `UniversalDataTable` component — column `{ key, title, sortable: true }` auto-manages sort headers
- Canonical API sort params: `sort_by` + `sort_order` (legacy `sort`/`direction`/`sort_dir` aliases retained)
- All list screens migrated: Fairs, Customers, Participations, Contacts, Activities, Imports, Admin Backups
- Backend whitelist tests extended; invalid sort fields fall back safely (no 400)
- URL sort state on Fairs, Customers, Imports, Backups list pages

### Architecture (documentation only — Sprint 09.2.5)

- **ADR-022** — System Administration & Business Continuity Roadmap (1–2 years)
- Official Admin → System navigation target; Business Continuity conceptual model
- Backup Policy Engine design (Daily / Weekly / Monthly, change detection, retention)
- Backup History, trigger types, bounded contexts (Backup vs Policy vs History vs DR vs Restore vs UDP)
- Future: cloud/remote backup (S3, Azure Blob, GCS, NAS), DR workspace, platform admin modules
- Updated: `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `CONSTITUTION.md`, `VISION.md`

### Product management (documentation only — Sprint 09.2.6)

- **ADR-023** — Tier-Based Product Delivery Strategy (Tier 1–4)
- Planning rule: Tier assignment before roadmap; default priority Tier 1 → 2 → 3 → 4
- Tier 1 gate: UX (Tier 3) does not outrank open foundation without documented override
- Updated: `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `CONSTITUTION.md`, `VISION.md`

## v0.9.3 — Admin Database Backup Workspace
