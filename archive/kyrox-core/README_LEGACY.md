# KYROX Core

**KYROX Core** is a reusable SaaS backend platform. It provides multi-tenant identity, authorization, shared infrastructure services, and API conventions that product applications build on top of—without embedding product-specific domain logic.

## What KYROX Core Is

- A **platform layer** for SaaS backends: tenants, users, roles, permissions, auth, audit, settings, files, and background jobs.
- A **stable foundation** that multiple products can depend on through clear integration contracts.
- An **architecture-first** repository: design and documentation precede implementation.

## What KYROX Core Is Not

- **Not a CRM.** FAIR CRM is the first product using Core; CRM entities and workflows do not belong here.
- **Not product-aware.** Core does not reference, import, or depend on any product repository or domain model.
- **Not a monolith of all KYROX features.** Product-specific business rules, UI concerns, and vertical features stay in product repos.

Seeded by migration `20260701_0025`. Assign to roles via Core RBAC; products enforce access through the authorization check API.

Protected org-scoped routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and `X-Organization-Id: <uuid>`.
