# KYROX Ecosystem Status

Single source of truth for **cross-repository current state**. Detailed product/Core status lives in the project status files linked below. Do not duplicate sprint histories, test-count histories or roadmap queues here.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Active milestone | **M4 — FAIR CRM v1** |
| Core policy | Frozen for speculative product work; bug/security/performance fixes and reusable product-driven platform needs are allowed |
| Documentation hub | `kyrox-platform` |
| Implementation repos | `kyrox-core`, `fair-crm` |
| Last ecosystem sync | **2026-08-19** |

## KYROX Core

Canonical detail: [projects/kyrox-core/PROJECT_STATUS.md](../projects/kyrox-core/PROJECT_STATUS.md)

Core remains the reusable, product-agnostic SaaS backend. Identity, authentication, authorization, organization/user/role governance and shared platform services are implemented in Core. Products consume Core through public HTTP contracts; product domain logic does not belong in Core.

The migration history has advanced substantially beyond the old `20260701_0025` documentation baseline and currently reaches `20260817_0059_repair_organization_admin_permissions`. Current-state details belong in the Core project status, not in permanent standards or roadmap documents.

## FAIR CRM

Canonical detail: [projects/fair-crm/PROJECT_STATUS.md](../projects/fair-crm/PROJECT_STATUS.md)  
Current work queue: [projects/fair-crm/ROADMAP.md](../projects/fair-crm/ROADMAP.md)

FAIR CRM remains the active M4 product. Existing implementation includes the CRM foundations, data integration/import flows, operations/automation flows, mail delivery flows, quotation-related capabilities and a cost-catalog implementation. Product documentation is being reconciled with the current code because the previous status/roadmap snapshot had fallen behind implementation.

The current documentation/quality focus is to keep Platform as the single human/AI knowledge source and to ensure permission-controlled UI surfaces consistently follow effective permissions and the shared CRUD/UI authorization standard.
